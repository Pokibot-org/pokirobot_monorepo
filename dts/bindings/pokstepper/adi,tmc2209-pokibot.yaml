  Analog Devices TMC2209 Stepper Motor Controller

  Example:

    &shared_uart0 {
        compatible = "zephyr,shared_uart";
        status = "okay";

        tmc2209_pokibot: tmc2209_pokibot {
            compatible = "adi,tmc2209_pokibot";
            status = "okay";
            address = <0>;

            /* common stepper controller settings */
            micro-step-res = <256>;
            /* tmc specific */
            ihold = <15>;
            irun = <31>;
            iholddelay = <10>;
        };
    };

      micro-step resolution to be set while initializing the device driver.

  ihold:
    required: true
    type: int
    default: 15

      Hold current in % of run current (0-100)
      Standstill current (0=1/32…31=32/32)
      In combination with StealthChop mode, setting IHOLD=0 allows to choose freewheeling or coil
      short circuit for motor stand still

  irun:
    type: int
    default: 31

      Motor run current (0=1/32…31=32/32)
      Hint: Choose sense resistors in a way, that normal
      IRUN is 16 to 31 for best microstep performance.

  iholddelay:
    type: int
    default: 8

      Controls the number of clock cycles for motor power down after a motion as soon as TZEROWAIT
      has expired. The smooth transition avoids a motor jerk upon power down.
      0: instant power down
      1..15: Delay per current reduction step in multiple of 2^18 clocks
